## Course Descriptions



### Undergraduate

#### Linear Systems and Signals (ECE 345)

I have taught this junior-level introduction to signals and systems for several years. In Fall 2022 I'll start the process of flipping the class using the video lectures developed during the last two years of remote instruction. 

**Semesters**: Fall 2023, Fall 2022, Fall 2021 (online), Fall 2020 (online), Fall 2019, Fall 2018, Fall 2017

#### Principles of Communication Systems (ECE 322)

This is a first course in communication systems, covering both analog and digital communications. The course used the textbook by Proakis and Salehi.

#### Signal and Data Analysis (ECE 436)

This was the "topics in ECE" elective course aimed at senioros which covered the basics of (non-deep) machine learning including PCA, classification/regression, and optimization methods. This material is now covered in a regular course, Machine Learning for Engineers (ECE 443)

**Semesters**: Fall 2016

#### Byrne Seminar on Data Science

Prof. [Waheed U. Bajwa](https://www.inspirelab.us/) and I taught a 1-credit seminar for first-year undergraduates through the [Byrne Seminar](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/byrne-seminars) program. The latest incarnation was called "Data Science: The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" and earlier versions were called "Data: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Something!)". We gave an introduction to data science and machine learning (at a more descriptive level) and discussed statistical, engineering, and ethical challenges when trying to use "data" to "solve" complex issues.

**Semesters**: Spring 2018, Fall 2015, Fall 2014


### Graduate

#### High Dimensional Models in DSP and ML (ECE 549)

This is an "advanced topics" class covering mathematical tools for analyzing high-dimensional statistics and machine learning problems. The material mostly followed the book <i>High Dimensional Probability</i> by Roman Vershynin. 

**Semesters**: Spring 2023, Spring 2022

#### Statistical Inference and Learning for Engineers (ECE 549)

This is a graduate course in statistical inference and machine learning which used to be called "Detection and Estimation Theory."

**Semesters**: Spring 2024, Spring 2022, Spring 2021 (online), Spring 2020 (partly online), Spring 2016, Spring 2015

#### Information Theory and Coding (ECE 542)

This is a standard first course in information theory, largely following the book of Cover and Thomas.

**Semesters**: Fall 2015, Spring 2014

#### Statistical Learning and Optimization (ECE 539)

I taught this "special topics" course once (and may never teach it again, alas). It covers the basics of statistical learning theory, including empirical risk minimization, VC dimension, and so on.

**Semesters**: Fall 2014
