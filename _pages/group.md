### Lab Members

My "lab" is a room full of desks. I have thus far resisted giving it a fancy name. 

**Graduate Students:**

*   Sinjini Banerjee (PhD)
*   [Daniel Bittner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-bittner-8776b728/) (PhD) (co-advised with [Rebecca Wright](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rwright/))
*   Xin Li (PhD)
*   Nitya Sathyavageeswaran (PhD) (co-advised with [Narayan Mandayam](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~narayan/) and [Roy Yates](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~ryates/))
*   Ye Tao (PhD)
*   Yu Wu (PhD)

**Undergraduate Students:**

*   Ashley Hart (undergraduate, University of Central Florida), Summer 2021 [RiSE REU](http://rise.rutgers.edu/)
*   Harry Fu (undergraduate, University of Michigan), Summer 2021 [DIMACS REU](http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/)

**For prospective graduate students:** Rutgers is an exciting place to learn and grow as an engineer. If you are specifically interested in my research, please look at my publications and projects. If you are applying to the department and want to pursue a Ph.D., apply to the Ph.D. program and mention your research interests in your statement. If you have _specific questions about my research_, feel free to contact me and mention that you have read this particular webpage. Unfortunately, I generally do not have the time to respond to general inquiries from potential students. I will not respond to emails that only contain a CV and a request for admission to my research group. 

**For undergraduate students:** If you're interested in an undergraduate research opportunity, please feel free to email me. Doing an independent research study is a great way to learn about research and expand your horizons beyond the classroom.
