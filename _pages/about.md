I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) 
at [Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey](https://www.rutgers.edu/). 
I also am a member of the graduate faculty in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) 
and the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.rutgers.edu/).
I like to work on problems that involve probability, mathematical statistics,  
and optimization, with applications in information theory, communication, 
signal processing, and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in
how these things intersect in the context of distributed/decentralized
systems with constraints like privacy, bandwidth, latency, power, and so on.

This page is still somewhat under construction. I anticipate that will
be the state for quite a while.
