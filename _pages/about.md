I am a an Associate Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I also am a member of the graduate faculty in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) and the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.rutgers.edu/).

All updates will be posted here but I am still porting content from my [previous homepage](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~asarwate/) hosted at Rutgers.
