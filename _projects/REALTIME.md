Deploying complex machine learning models on resource-constrained devices is
challenging due to limited computational power, memory, and model retrainabil-
ity. One proposal is to have mobile devices offload computation to processing centers which are physically closer than the abstract "cloud." These *mobile edge cloud (MEC)* systems raise a number of interesting challenges in terms of latency, accuracy, energy efficiency, and privacy (among others).
