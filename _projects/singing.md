I've been a choral singer since middle school (more or less) and in college I minored in both music and theater. With music I focused more on composition but that has fallen by the wayside. I currently take voice lessons with Taina Kataja.

I currently sing with the [New York Chamber Chorus](https://www.chamberchoirs.nyc/) and am now entering my third season singing with them. It's good to be singing again after a bit of a hiatus from running on the hamster wheel of the tenure track.
