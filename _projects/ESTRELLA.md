This was an [NSF-funded project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1910110) about how to use "simpler" structured models for tensors based on factorizations and decompositions in statistical and machine learning models. In particular, we are looking at low separation rank (LSR) tensor models, which offer a flexible framework for increasing the number of parameters of the statistical model.
