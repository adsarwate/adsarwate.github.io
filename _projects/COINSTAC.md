This is a large-scale project, [funded by the NIH](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=10058463&icde=52973632), to build a platform for collaborative research using neuroimaging. I work on aspects of decentralized/"federated" learning and understanding how privacy can be guaranteed in such systems. Our current efforts are focused on understanding privacy in data visualization.

See the [COINSTAC site](https://coinstac.org/) for all the details!
