A **bunch** of updates after not so many updates: 

* The site has been updated with more content, including [slides from some recent talks](https://adsarwate.github.io/slides/).

* I was awarded the Presidential Outstanding Faculty Scholar Award by Rutgers. This is given to faculty getting promoted to Professor (from Associate). However, I have not received official notification for the promotion so I'll just assume the award is a good sign (?)

* Our monograph is finally done!
   * Dey et al, [Codes for Adversaries: Between Worst-Case and Average-Case Jamming](http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0100000112), Foundations and Trends in Communications and Information Theory, 2024. This is is the culmination of 15+ years of research we've been doing on adversarial channel models!

* Preprints!
   * Vargas et al., [Understanding Generative AI Content with Embedding Models](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.10437), under review.
   * Tao et al., [Privacy-Preserving Visualization of Brain Functional Connectivity](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/15/2024.10.11.617267), about to be submitted.
   * Banerjee et al., [Measuring model variability using robust non-parametric testing](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.08307), revision under review.

* Journal and conference papers!
   * Tao and Sarwate, [Differentially Private Distribution Estimation Using Functional Approximation](https://adsarwate.github.io/publications/), ICASSP 2025. We look at CDF approximation using functional approximation. A journal version is in the works.
   * Wu et al., [Learning to Help in Multi-Class Settings](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NCgTbt2j1F), ICLR 2025. We study a variation on learning with abstention to design effective "helpers" for resource-constrained devices needing to do ML/AI stuff.
   * Tao et al., [Federated Privacy-Preserving Visualization: A Vision Paper](https://adsarwate.github.io/publications/), IEEE BigData 2024. We're looking at where and when private visualization might be useful.
   * Sathyavageeswaran et al., [Timely Offloading in Mobile Edge Cloud Systems](https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW61385.2024.10806971), ITW 2024. We use an MDP framework to analyze computational offloading policies.
   * Dey, et al., [Computationally Efficient Codes for Strongly Dobrushin-Stambler Nonsymmetrizable Oblivious AVCs](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT57864.2024.10619362), ISIT 2024. We develop polynomial time codes for classes of adversarial channels!
   * A. D. Sarwate, [Machine learning with differential privacy](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003185284-9), a chapter in the *Handbook of Sharing Confidential Data Differential Privacy, Secure Multiparty Computation, and Synthetic Data* from CRC. A limited survey of "classical" ML under differential privacy, more aimed at potential practitioners.
   * Rootes-Murdy et al., [Cortical similarities in psychiatric and mood disorders identified in federated VBM analysis via COINSTAC](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389924001028), *Patterns*, 2024. A use-case for [COINSTAC](https://www.coinstac.org/), the federated learning platform for neuroimaging analysis on which I have been collaborating for the last 10 years.
