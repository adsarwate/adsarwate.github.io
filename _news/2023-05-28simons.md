Just returned from a really fabulous workshop on [Information-Theoretic Methods for Trustworthy Machine Learning
](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/asu-it-ml) at the [
Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. It was weird to wander around a place I lived 20 years ago but really nice to see old friends and meet new people.
